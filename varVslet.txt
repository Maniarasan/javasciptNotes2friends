What to use ‘let’ or ‘var’ ?

* var - has function level scoping and can change the value reference
* let - has block level scoping and can change the value reference


Try this out for yourself and decide. 

var a = 10
let  q = 20

for (q =2;q<10;q++){ console.log(q); }

O/p : undefined

for (a;a<20;a++){console.log(a)}

// prints 10 to 19

From the above runs we can understand that var has a global scope and let has block scope.

But when it comes to functions, var and let behave the same way.  The scope of both ends within the function. 

function f() {let q = 10 ; var s = 35; console.log(s)}


The above example states that we have a better control with let. But let was introduced only after ES6. 

My advice to you : 

* If you are writing code that will executed a controlled environment where you know let and const are supported, don't use var.
* The best place for this is nodejs modules. If you use nodejs 6.5 and above your environment supports ES6, thus the let and const keywords.
* If you are writing for an enterprise that has deprecated Internet Explorer for Edge and other modern browsers then go ahead and use ES6 syntax.
* If your code might run on Internet Explorer or older Android phones you may want to stick to the ES5 syntax and only use var to declare variables.
* Of course if you use TypeScript or Bable you can have them transpile your code to ES5. I am not a huge fan of this approach as I think the code gets a little funky to debug.
